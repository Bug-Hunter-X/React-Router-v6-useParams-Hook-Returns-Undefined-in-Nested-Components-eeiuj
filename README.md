This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Router v6 where the `useParams` hook returns undefined or incorrect values when used in deeply nested components. The issue is caused by the asynchronous nature of React Router's rendering process. The solution involves using the `Outlet` component and ensuring that the component using the hook is rendered only after the parent route's parameters are resolved. The example shows how to reproduce the bug and how to fix it using the `Outlet`.
